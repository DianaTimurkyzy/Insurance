# Insurance application
The Spring Boot CRUD application displays data related to banks, banks' owners, insurances, customers and transactions stored in MySQL and also allows interaction with this data. 
I developed a fully functional MVC layer complete with repository and service logic. For the view layer and data transmission from Java, I employed the Thymeleaf engine.


## Usage
You should download a MySQL database and run the project. Liquibase will automatically create the schema and all tables.


#### **Technologies that were used**:
* Language: Java 11
* Framework: Hibernate, Spring (Core, Boot, MVC, Data, Validation )
* Database: SQL (MySQL)
* Database Migration: Liquibase
* Front-end: HTML, CSS, Thymeleaf
* Other tools: Git, Maven, GitHub , Lombok
